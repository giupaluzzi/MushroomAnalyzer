# MushroomAnalyzer

**MushroomAnalyzer** is an AI-powered tool designed to classify different mushroom species using cutting-edge computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This project combines technology and biology to help users identify mushrooms and learn detailed information about their characteristics.

## Features
- **Image-Based Classification**: Automatically identify mushroom species from uploaded images using advanced computer vision algorithms.  
- **Detailed Information Retrieval**: Generate descriptions of identified mushrooms, including edibility, habitat, and distinguishing features, powered by NLP.  
- **User-Friendly Workflow**: A straightforward interface for easy use by both professionals and hobbyists.

## Technologies Used
- **Computer Vision**: Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for precise image recognition.
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLP models to provide contextual information about mushroom species.
- **Frameworks**: Built using OpenCV, [ADD OTHER FRAMEWORKS]
